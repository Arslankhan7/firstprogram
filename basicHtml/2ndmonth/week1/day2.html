                <h2>JAVA</h2>
                <p>Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It was created by James Gosling and his team with the goal of providing a platform-independent language that could be used for developing a wide range of applications. Java quickly gained popularity due to its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle, which means that Java code can run on any device or platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
